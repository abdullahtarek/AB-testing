# AB Testing    
## Intoroduction 
This project is aimed to help a company understand if they should implement a new desing of a web page or stay with the old page based on the results achieved from AB testing. Also this project uses a regression model that can predict if a user will convert or not.

## Requirements
* Python2.7 or 3
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib

## Project
### Part 1: Using descriptive statistics to determine whether the new page is better than the old one.
This part is mainly cleaning the data so that we have the data of the control group going to the old page and the treatment group going to the new page. Then getting the average convergence rate for both the tratment and control goups.
### Part2: AB Testing(Hypotyhesis test)
This part of the project uses a hypothesis test where the null hypothesis is that the convergence of the old page is greater than or equal the new page and the alternative hypothesis is that the new page have a higher than the old one.
### Part3: regression
This final part is predicting whether a vister will converge or not using regression.
